## Self Assessment
I started SNHU very nervously.. I knew i wanted to become a Software Engineer by the age of 6. But i hated school. I thought i couldnt do it. Fast forward to 2020 during Covid when the world shut down i had to start my Physics classes and i was insanely scared. I didnt think i could do it, i thought i was going to fail out of school with this and not be able to live my dream. Fast forward 8 weeks and i pass the class with a B. It was such a fun class. I told myself if i could get through that then nothing will stop me. Few years later i am at the end of my Bachelors degree and now have a interview with the NSA as a Cyber Security Engineer. Crazy how things happen.

## Reflection
During my 4 years here i learned amazing skills and found new strengths within me. I learned that if i could put my mind to it, i can make it happen. My CS330 class was insanely hard. I failed but i am currently taking it and im understanding it so much more and actually passing it! This shown me how to be a better coder and actually take pride in very complicated projects because the end result is so rewarding. 

## Summary
The artifacts i chose for this class was my first coding project ever and one of the most recents i did outside of school. The first one is a very simple project and the last one i did was more complex. The more complex one allowed me to freely show my skills ive obtained from school and dedication from hard work outside of classes. With what i learned these past 3 years i can confidently say i am ready to get my career started.

Final week to work on it. Source code is finished at this point, JSON file is finished now i need to work on my "exceptions". This will show me a status code on when the song is successfully transferred to my Spotify playlist.

Week Seven - 
Final review of code. Video will be in a link because file size was too big.

Enhancement One-
In my first python project in the code review i went and added more features after the video. I added more options to choose from. I tried to do some automation but could not figure it out. At this point i had an error to fix which i found and fixed. At this point there was not much more i could add to this program because it was very simple.

Enhancement Two -
I started a new project. I made a Youtube liked videos to Spotify playlist converter. This project was really fun. I didnt need a use for a database for this but i did have a JSON file in place of a database. Please see the code review to see everything about it! Link(https://youtu.be/shKmGD3qGcg).
