Week Seven - 
Final review of code. Video will be in a link because file size was too big.

Enhancement One-
In my first python project in the code review i went and added more features after the video. I added more options to choose from. I tried to do some automation but could not figure it out. At this point i had an error to fix which i found and fixed. At this point there was not much more i could add to this program because it was very simple.

Enhancement Two -
I started a new project. I made a Youtube liked videos to Spotify playlist converter. This project was really fun. I didnt need a use for a database for this but i did have a JSON file in place of a database. Please see the code review to see everything about it! Link(https://youtu.be/shKmGD3qGcg).
